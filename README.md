JavaScript Element Visibility Toggle

This project is a simple JavaScript code snippet that allows you to toggle the visibility of three HTML elements based on the click events of other elements with specific class names. This can be useful for creating interactive user interfaces where different sections or information can be shown or hidden dynamically.

Usage

To use this code in your project, follow these steps:

1. Include the JavaScript code in your HTML file or link to it from an external script file.
<script src="your-script.js"></script>
2. Create the HTML structure with elements that you want to control.
<div id="display1">Content for Box 1</div>
<div id="display2">Content for Box 2</div>
<div id="display3">Content for Box 3</div>

<div class="box1">Click to Show Box 1</div>
<div class="box2">Click to Show Box 2</div>
<div class="box3">Click to Show Box 3</div>
3. Customize the HTML elements' IDs and class names to match your project's requirements.

4. The JavaScript code will handle the rest. When elements with class "box1," "box2," or "box3" are clicked, the code will hide the other boxes and display the corresponding box.

Example

Here's an example of how to set up and use this code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="your-script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="display1">Content for Box 1</div>
    <div id="display2">Content for Box 2</div>
    <div id="display3">Content for Box 3</div>
   
    <div class="box1">Click to Show Box 1</div>
    <div class="box2">Click to Show Box 2</div>
    <div class="box3">Click to Show Box 3</div>
</body>
</html>
